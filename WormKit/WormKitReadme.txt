== WormKit ==

WormKit is an extension framework for Worms Armageddon, which consists of a 
module loader, and a set of modules, each with a different purpose.

There are currently several publicly released WormKit modules, 
out of which 4 come with the default WormKit distribution. They are:

* WormNAT2 - allows hosting games even if you're behind a router or firewall;
* FileOverride - override files from the CD-ROM with your versions;
* AntiKeyboardHook - stop Worms from disabling Alt+Tab / Win+... keyboard combinations.
* SoundCardSelect - choose the soundcard W:A should use for sound output.

WormKit was first released on April 5, 2006. A full history of WormKit can be 
found on the WormKit homepage: http://worms.thecybershadow.net/wormkit/

== Usage Instructions ==

To activate a module, simply copy its files from the WormKitModules folder to 
your Worms: Armageddon folder. (Note: you need to copy the contents of the 
folder, not the folder itself). 

== Installation ==

To install WormKit, unpack the contents of WormKit.zip to your Worms: Armageddon 
folder. Activate the desired modules, then update your desktop shortcuts to point 
to WormKit.exe instead of WA.exe. Some high-resolution icons are included for W:A 
and WormKit.
