This module creates a "Virtual" speech bank 
Each time Worms tries to open a file from the CD, this module tries to 
check to see if you have the same file in your DATA folder.
So, if Worms tries to open, for example, "D:\Data\Water\Blue\Water.dir", 
wkFileOverride will see if you have a 
"C:\Worms Armageddon\DATA\Water\Blue\Water.dir", and if you do, it 
"substitutes" the CD-ROM file with that 
(above example is assuming D: is your CD-ROM drive and you installed 
Worms to "C:\Worms Armageddon\").
Note that this plug-in will NOT let you play without a CD-ROM - 
either in your CD drive or mounted as an ISO :)
