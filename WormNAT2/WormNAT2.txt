WormNAT2 hooks up W:A with a reverse proxy. Basically,
it hosts games on the proxy server, and the proxy routes
data between the joining players and the host. The proxy
itself is currently hosted on a dedicated server in Paris,
France.

Unlike the first version, no configuration is required.
Just copy the three DLL files to your W:A folder to 
activate the module.

Of course, we'd much rather that you configure hosting
the normal way. You can find a detailed guide on how to
set up hosting here:
