If this module is loaded, it automatically tries to click its way
from the main menu to #AnythingGoes. It's not exactly "dumb" macroing,
since it waits for the next menu/window to appear before proceeding to 
click in another zone.

You can temporarily disable this module by holding down Shift while
Worms is starting up. Or you could press Esc a few times - if the
module detects that you went back a screen, it'll stop.

Note, that it's not possible to find the position of the "Log in to 
WormNET" link in the Worms browser (without doing some wicked OCR, at 
least); so I've assumed that you've installed my WormNET server browser
page, and didn't modify it. 
(you can get it at http://wormse.thecybershadow.net/wormnet/ , it won't 
affect your capability to play on Team17 WormNET in any way ;) )
